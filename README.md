# Project: Stock Price Prediction using Prophet

This project utilizes Python and the Prophet library to perform time series forecasting for stock price prediction.

## Project Overview

*   **Purpose:** This project aims to explore the use of time series forecasting techniques, specifically the Prophet library, for predicting future stock prices based on historical data. The objective is to identify trends and patterns in stock prices that can be used for making predictions.

## Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Machine Learning Library:** Prophet (developed by Meta, formerly Facebook)
*  **Data Source:** The project uses data from libraries or the data is included with the project.

## Project Description

*   **Time Series Forecasting:** The project focuses on time series analysis, using Prophet, a library designed for forecasting time series data. Prophet is well-suited for data with strong seasonality and trend components.
*   **Stock Price Prediction:** The project applies the Prophet model to historical stock price data to predict future stock prices.
*   **Trend Identification:** The model is used to identify trends and patterns in historical stock prices.

## Key Features

*   **Data Loading:** The application loads historical stock price data.
*  **Model Training:** The Prophet model is trained on the historical data.
*   **Prediction Generation:** The trained model generates future stock price predictions.
*   **Trend Visualization:** The project provides visualizations of the historical data along with the predicted values to help in understanding the trends.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install prophet pandas matplotlib
    ```    
3.  **Run Project:** Execute the python script or jupyter notebook using python:
    ```bash

## Key Learnings

*   Through this project, I gained practical experience in applying time series forecasting techniques using the Prophet library. I learned how to preprocess data, train a Prophet model, and interpret the forecast results to understand trends in stock prices. This project also provided a good understanding of how to visualize the predictions and historical trends.

## Usage

*   This project serves as a demonstration of how to use time series forecasting for stock price prediction. It can be further developed as a tool for gaining insights into potential stock performance.
